# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason for this webpage is that I find it very helpful to keep pertinent information saved so that I can refer back to it. This is especially true for functions and topics since I may forgot a method of doing something and I regret not having it written down somewhere.

By storing all my notes in one place, it's easy to gloss over and review details that I forgot or needed to refer back to the syntax before using. In the future, I may end up adding more functionality for grouping and collapsing so that I can have my notes organized and stored so it can all fit within the scope of the window size.
